cornerstone
===========

The goal of this project is to make it easy to enable HTML5 based web apps to display interactive medical images:

 * Easy - use of the library should be familiar for someone with experience in web technologies - knowledge of DICOM
or medical imaging should not be required
 * Medical images - this includes all DICOM image types as well as non DICOM Image types
 * Interactive - All rendering is done on the client side including window/level, zoom, pan, etc.
