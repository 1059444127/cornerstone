**NOTE - please use Google Chrome if you can as the other browsers are not tested frequently right now (although they should work)**

Project Vision
==============

 * HTML5/Javascript based library to easily add interactive medical images to web applications
 * Serves as a foundation to build more complex medical imaging applications from - enterprise viewer, report viewer, etc.
 * Supports all HTML5 based browsers including mobile, tablet and desktop
 * Displays all common medical image formats (e.g. 8 bit grayscale, 16 bit grayscale, RGB)
 * High performance image display
 * Retrieval of images from different systems with different protocols via Image Loader plugin design
 * API support for changing viewport properties (e.g. ww/wc, zoom, pan, invert)
