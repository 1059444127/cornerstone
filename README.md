cornerstone
===========

The goal of this project is to make it easy to enable HTML5 based web apps to display interactive medical images:

 * Easy - use of the library should be familiar for someone with experience in web technologies - knowledge of DICOM
or medical imaging should not be required
 * Medical images - this includes all DICOM image types as well as non DICOM Image types
 * Interactive - All rendering is done on the client side including window/level, zoom, pan, etc.

Project Status: proof of concept

Vision
======
 * HTML5/Javascript based library to easily add interactive medical images to web applications
 * Supports all HTML5 based browsers including mobile, tablet and desktop
 * Displays all DICOM image types
 * Displays non DICOM image types (e.g. JPEG from camera)
 * High performance image display
 * Cross platform server (tested on Linux and Windows)
 * Server plugin interface to allow interfacing with image archives in different ways (e.g. DIMSE, WADO, custom)
 * Serves as a foundation to build more complex medical imaging applications from - enterprise viewer, report viewer, etc.
 * Easily extendable by developers to add custom tools (e.g. measurement, ROI, filters, etc)
