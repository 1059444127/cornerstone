Backlog:
========
 * Events - image updated, viewport property changed, etc
 * Examples showing touch UI
 * load images from a server (not the example embedded images)
 * More browser platforms
 * More image types
   * signed 16 bit gray
   * 8 bit gray
   * color types (RGB,)
   * JPEG or PNG
   * MONOCHROME1 vs MONOCHROME2
 * Large image support (e.g. mammo, large CR > 512x512 resolution )
 * Very large image support (e.g. pathology > 4kx4k resolution)
 * more viewport functionality
     * Rotation (90, 180, 270, 0)
     * Flip (Horizontal / Vertical)
     * invert
 * Performance related
   * Multiresolution image streaming
   * image compression
   * Optimize image display
 * Overlays (e.g. to support drawing lines/text on top of image for measurement tools)
 * server plugin to communicate with archive via DIMSE
 * server plugin to communicate with archive via WADO
 * Prebuilt tools for common ui paradigms (e.g. left click w/l, mouse wheel zoom, middle mouse pan)
 * Programmatic access to raw pixel data (for tools like ROI)
 * Caching of pixel data to HTML5 local storage?
 * image cache management
 * packaged as a bower module
 * jquery plugin wrapper to make it easier to use with jquery
 * AMD wrapper to make it easier to use with AMD loaders

Future Possibilities
=================================
  * 3D functionality - MPR, MIP, Volume Rendering
  * Fusion (e.g. PET/CT, CT/MR)
