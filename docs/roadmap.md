-------
 * Target browser OS: Mac OS X (desktop)
 * Target browser: Google Chrome
 * Display of 16 bit unsigned MRI Image from hardcoded pixel data (no server, just HTTP Get)

 * Programmatic support for modifying the following:
    * Window/Center adjustments
    * Zooming/Scaling
    * Panning/Translating
    * Image displayed
 * Markup mode - static configuration done via HTML5 data attributes, no javascript needed
